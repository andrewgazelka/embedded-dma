//! Traits to aid the correct use of buffers in DMA abstractions.
//!
//! This library provides the `ReadBuffer` and `WriteBuffer` unsafe traits to be used as bounds to
//! buffers types used in DMA operations.
//!
//! There are some subtleties to the extent of the guarantees provided by these traits, all of these
//! subtleties are properly documented in the safety requirements in this crate. However, as a
//! measure of redundancy, some are listed below:
//!
//! * The traits only guarantee a stable location while no `&mut self` methods are called upon
//! `Self` (with the exception of [`write_buffer`](trait.WriteBuffer.html#tymethod.write_buffer) in
//! our case). This is to allow types like `Vec`, this restriction doesn't apply to `Self::Target`.
//!
//! * The location is only guaranteed to be stable for the duration of `Self`, that means that
//! `Self` doesn't need to be `'static`, i.e. `&'a [u8]` is valid. This can be a bit subtle for
//! most DMA abstractions, because they almost always require `'static`, given the intrinsics of
//! `mem::forget` and the Rust language itself. Those APIs must also bound to `'static` and not only
//! `WriteBuffer`/`ReadBuffer`. The reason we don't require `'static` in the traits themselves is
//! because it would block implementations that can deal with stack allocated buffers, like APIs
//! that use closures to prevent memory corruption.
//!
//! If your API also needs a `'static` bound, prefer the use of [StaticReadBuffer] and
//! [StaticWriteBuffer]. They are a stricter version that requires a `'static` lifetime invariant,
//! while also allowing end users to __unsafely__ bypass it.
//!
//! If you are not sure which version of the traits you should be bounding to in your DMA
//! implementations, prefer the "Static" versions, they are sound for a bigger number of techniques
//! that deal with DMA.
//!
//! The above list is not exhaustive, for a complete set of requirements and guarantees, the
//! documentation of each trait and method should be analyzed.
//!
